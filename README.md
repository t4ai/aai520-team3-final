# QA Generative Chatbot
AAI-520 Team 3 Final Project

ThreeSoft is a software development company that has disrupted the enterprise collaboration space with its streamlined suite of online document management and advanced online document editors powered by Generative AI.  ThreeSoft is an “AI-first” company and the AI engineers work closely with the product team to use the CRISP-DM process to define and deliver new AI-powered features and products.

In support of ThreeSoft’s vision to infuse AI into every aspect of their enterprise collaboration suite, the product team has identified a new feature that would help users work more efficiently as they review and edit documents using ThreeSoft’s collaborative tools.  In interviews with customers, a common difficulty that users encounter is gaining insights into large documents when they are being reviewed across team members.  Today, users must read the full text and digest all the facts contained therein.  Instead, customers have asked for an embedded virtual assistant bot that they can submit/highlight a portion of text in the document and ask questions about it.  This will greatly streamline users’ ability to gain understanding of document content they are reviewing and collaborating around.  

The goal of this project will be to develop generative chatbot that will power such a virtual assistant question/answer (QA) experience and provide a fluid question and answering dialog experience to ThreeSoft’s users.
